# Playwright Example

A basic example combining [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) and Virtual Screen Reader.

This includes a test asserting on the basic navigation of the <http://guidepup.dev> homepage.

Run this example with:

```bash
cd examples/playwright
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
yarn test
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This example serves to demonstrate how you can use the Virtual Screen Reader. The components themselves may not be using best accessibility practices.
>
> Always evaluate your own components for accessibility and test with real users.
